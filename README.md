# Insurance Document OCR Project
This project explores Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract key information from insurance documents, specifically focusing on identifying start and end dates.

## Highlights
- Flexible Date Detection: The solution can handle a variety of date formats, ensuring robust coverage across different document styles.
- Components:
    - `date_finder`: A set of regular expressions designed to detect and extract dates in various formats.
    - `Pytesseract` Integration: Utilizes the Tesseract OCR engine to recognize text and visually display the detected characters overlaid on the document image.
# Purpose
This project demonstrates the potential of OCR and regex for automating the extraction of structured data from unstructured documents, with applications in streamlining workflows in industries such as insurance and legal services.
